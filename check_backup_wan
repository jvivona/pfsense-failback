# If the primary WAN IP address is not available, assume the primary WAN is still down.
# Assuming the primary WAN is still up, check if there any live TCP connections on the backup WAN.
# If live TCP connections are found on the backup WAN, check that the primary WAN is responding to
# pings on the monitor IP address.  If the primary WAN is responding to pings, then kill the states
# on the backup WAN, and they will automatically reconnect over the primary WAN.
